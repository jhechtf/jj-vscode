# jj-vscode README

Jujutsu is a next-generation Version Control System (VCS), and this aims to be an integration for JJ in VSCode.

## NOTE

This extension is very early stages; I (jhechtf) have never built an SCM extension for VSCode before, so I'm learning a lot of the ins and outs of how to do that as I go. For now, I do _not_ recommend using it by anyone who isn't interested in actively helping the development
